# Plant-disease-detection

Given a plant leaf image, the model detects the health condition of the leaf. The model can classify the images into 27 classes and achieved train, validation and test accuracies of 94, 90 and 90 respectively. A custom model with two convolutional layers and three linear layers is designed to classify the images. A good amount of preprocessing is done before providing the image as input to the model and resnet weights were used to normalize the images.
